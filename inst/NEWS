# Change log of the R package 'chronosphere'

## [0.1.0 (build 23)]  - 2019-10-09 (Adam)
### Changed
- Server location, publicity of files and repository structure. 

## [0.1.0 (build 22)]  - 2019-10-08 (Adam)
### Added
- The multiextract() function. 

### Changed
- The climate_velocity() was renamed to the much shorter 'vocc()'

## [0.1.0 (build 21)]  - 2019-09-7 (Adam)
### Changed
- package name changed from 'earthhist' to 'chronosphere'

## [0.0.1 (build 20)]  - 2019-09-25 (Adam)
### Changed
- remote server variable place

## [0.0.1 (build 19)]  - 2019-09-25 (Adam)
### Added
- enumerate argument to the reconstruct()-matrix method, for different age vectorization

## [0.0.1 (build 18)]  - 2019-09-24 (Adam)
### Added
- chunk argument to reconstruct()-matrix-method, limiting the number of points to be reconstrcuted in one go

### Changed
- Wrapped the gplates_reconstruct_points() function in IteratedPointReconstruction() to iteratively query points, thus evading error with too long URL

## [0.0.1 (build 17)]  - 2019-09-19 (Adam)
### Changed
- tiny bug fix in fetch()

## [0.0.1 (build 16)]  - 2019-08-14 (Adam)
### Added
- versions to the layer names for better robustness

### Changed
- fetch() bug fix, one line did not do its job, the other one, truncated the output, 
messing up the order of the layers, leading to misalignment between RasterArray proxy indices and layer names
- test examples changed for DEM

## [0.0.1 (build 12)]  - 2019-07-25 (Adam)
### Added
- reconstruct() wrapper function for all gplates web serviced based functions

## [0.0.1 (build 9)]  - 2019-07-21 (Adam)
### Added
- the matchtime() function was added for matching series of maps with a predefined time scale.

## [0.0.1 (build 8)]  - 2019-07-20 (Adam)
### Added
- unit testing framework established specific example for fetch()
- resample() and crop() methods added for RasterArray

## [0.0.1 (build 7)]  - 2019-07-19/2 (Adam)
### Added
- first version registry
- 'paleoatlas' variable
- mapplot() function
- jpeg suggested package

- earthhist_map dataset to "paleomap" 


## [0.0.1 (build 6)]  - 2019-07-19 (Adam) 
### Added
- first version of the fetch function
- layers() function to show the names of the individual RasterLayers. Does the same as names(<RasterStack>). 

### Changed
- names() method of the RasterArray outputs index names


## [0.0.1 (build 4)]  - 2019-07-15 (Adam) 
### Added
- Change log (/inst/NEWS)
