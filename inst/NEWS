## [0.1.2 (build 27)]  - 2019-10-20 (Adam)
### Added
- as.data.frame S3 method for RasterArray making the View() function work

## [0.1.1 (build 26)]  - 2019-10-19 (Adam)
### Added
- The cbind() method for the RasterArrays... a nightmare.

## [0.1.0 (build 24)]  - 2019-10-16 (Adam)
### Changed
- Minor fix to reconstruct() function.

## [0.1.0 (build 23)]  - 2019-10-09 (Adam)
### Changed
- Server location, publicity of files and repository structure. 

## [0.1.0 (build 22)]  - 2019-10-08 (Adam)
### Added
- The multiextract() function. 

### Changed
- The climate_velocity() was renamed to the much shorter 'vocc()'

## [0.1.0 (build 21)]  - 2019-09-7 (Adam)
### Changed
- package name changed from 'earthhist' to 'chronosphere'

## [0.0.1 (build 20)]  - 2019-09-25 (Adam)

## [0.0.1 (build 19)]  - 2019-09-25 (Adam)
### Added
- enumerate argument to the reconstruct()-matrix method, for different age vectorization

## [0.0.1 (build 18)]  - 2019-09-24 (Adam)
### Added
- chunk argument to reconstruct()-matrix-method, limiting the number of points to be reconstrcuted in one go

### Changed
- Wrapped the gplates_reconstruct_points() function in IteratedPointReconstruction() to iteratively query points, thus evading error with too long URL

## [0.0.1 (build 17)]  - 2019-09-19 (Adam)
### Changed
- tiny bug fix in fetch()

## [0.0.1 (build 16)]  - 2019-08-14 (Adam)
